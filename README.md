# REST-API
What is an REST API ?
A REST API, also known as a RESTful API, is a simple, uniform interface that is used to make data, content, algorithms, media, and other digital resources available through web URLs.

Working: A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services. 



The method is the type of request you send to the server. The four main resource methods that are associated with REST APIs are:

GET: This method allows for the server to find the data you requested and sends it back to you.

PUT: If you perform the ‘PUT’ request, then the server will update an entry in the database.

POST: This method permits the server to create a new entry in the database.

DELETE: This method allows the server to delete an entry in the database.
