What is an REST API ?
A REST API, also known as a RESTful API, is a simple, uniform interface that is used to make data, content, algorithms, media, and other digital resources available through web URLs.

Working: A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.
